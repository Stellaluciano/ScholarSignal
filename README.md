# ScholarSignal
ScholarSignal is an open-source research recommender that tracks new arXiv papers and surfaces a small set of personalized reads each day. It adapts to what you browse, download, and save, gradually refining its ranking over time. Designed for transparency and experimentation, it runs fully self-hosted with no lock-in.
